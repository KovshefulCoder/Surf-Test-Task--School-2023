## –°—Ç–µ–∫
* Kotlin
* Jetpack Compose
* MVVM
* Compose navigation
* Hilt
* Room
* Material/Material 3 elements

## What has been implemented

* **UI**: The entire application interface and navigation logic have been fully implemented. Specifically, all buttons lead to the required screens, mandatory field validation is in place, a fixed-size Bottom Sheet with scrollable content, and a container with a cutout for the FAB (Floating Action Button).
* **Functionality**: After the initial opening, a welcome screen is displayed. Pressing the + button opens a cocktail creation form. Upon saving, the main menu opens with the saved cocktail. **Upon subsequent app launches, the welcome screen is not displayed**, as the user has already saved cocktails.
* **Cocktail Creation**: From the main screen, pressing the FAB allows the creation of a new cocktail.
* **Cocktail Editing**: Pressing a cocktail in the main menu opens its description in a Bottom Sheet with an EDIT button. Clicking this button opens a cocktail editing form. Values entered in the form will overwrite the selected cocktail's parameters upon clicking the SAVE button.
* **Container for FAB**: A container with a cutout for the FAB has been implemented on the main menu screen, following the design.
* **Room Implementation**: All interfaces and settings for working with cocktails **and ingredients** have been fully implemented. Only their usage remains.

## What has not been implemented

* Cocktail creation logic works correctly. However, due to a highly non-obvious [Room behavior](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44109700/how-to-make-primary-key-as-autoincrement-for-room-persistence-lib#:~:text=A%20note%20for%20future%20readers%20%2D%20the%20primary%20key%20must%20be%200%20for%20Room%20to%20treat%20it%20as%20unset.%20If%20you%20use%20any%20other%20default%20value%20(e.g.%20-1)%2C%20Room%20will%20not%20autogenerate%20the%20id.), entered values overwrite the existing cocktail when writing to the database. This has been fixed in the [after-shock](https://github.com/KovshefulCoder/Surf-Test-Task--School-2023/tree/after-shock) branch.
* Cocktail editing logic works correctly. However, the previous cocktail parameters are not transferred to the editing screen.
* There is no functionality in place for working with ingredients. Cocktails cannot be added with ingredients, and consequently, ingredients cannot be removed.
